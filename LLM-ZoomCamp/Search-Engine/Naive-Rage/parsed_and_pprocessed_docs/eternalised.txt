You wake up in the morning, feeling as if you have barely slept, but duty calls and you must rise. Instinctively, you reach for your phone and look at messages, notifications, e-mails, or social media. Someone boasts about his wealth, another posts about her recent adventure in an exotic place. You start to feel envious. You glance at the news: corrupt politicians, protests, scandals, disasters. And you feel irritated, but quickly mask it with a sense of superiority, at least you are better than those people, you think.



You’re stuck in traffic on your way to the office. You think about what you’ll say when you’re late. Gradually, irritation builds, and you find yourself cursing the other drivers. But you manage to arrive on time.



At lunch break you sit with your colleagues. They complain about low pay, greedy and corrupt rich people, and gossip about others. You join in the conversation, not entirely because you agree, but partly to avoid feeling left out.



As you return to your desk, you see a co-worker who always irritates you. He wears an expensive suit that seems to define him and acts superior to everyone else. He is smart, good-looking, popular, and earns more than you, even though you work much harder and no one seems to notice. Every time you approach, he either avoids you or acts as if he hasn’t seen you.



After work, you head to the gym. You notice an attractive woman and your thoughts turn to lust. In your mind, she becomes an object of desire rather than a human being. The woman looks at you, and you quickly glance away, feeling a sudden rush of embarrassment, as if she could read your thoughts.



On your way home, you greet a neighbour you barely know, but he doesn’t respond.  Immediately, you regret having said anything. By the time you reach your apartment, you are completely drained. A casual remark from someone you live with unexpectedly fills you with overwhelming wrath, and you lash out before shutting yourself in your room. You feel envious of how easily others seem to have it, but also cling to the thought that, in some ways, you’re still better than them. Your room is chaotic, making it hard to find the things you need, and your small apartment frustrates you. You can’t stop imagining what it would be like to have a bigger, nicer place.



Hunger and stress take over, and you eat too much junk food, even though you have been trying to lose weight. You think about that book that you bought long ago on self-realisation, but a desire to watch your favourite series or play a game takes over, and long-term fulfillment is sacrificed for short-term pleasure. Because you do not confront your emotional turmoil, your emotions become repressed and create further neurosis (inner division).



Hours pass, and it gets late. Suddenly, images of lust overwhelm you, and you watch pornography and masturbate. Afterwards, you feel guilty, followed by anger at how you’ve spent the day and at yourself, self-sabotaging your own efforts.



You feel useless, and wonder why you cannot attain what you truly desire - love, virtue, and discipline - and instead fall into hatred, sin, and sloth. St Paul’s words come to your mind, “For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.” At last, you resolve to improve yourself tomorrow, and eventually, sleep overtakes you.





You wake up in the morning, feeling as if you have barely slept, but duty calls and you must rise. Instinctively, you reach for your phone and look at messages, notifications, e-mails, or social media. Someone boasts about their wealth, another posts about their recent adventure in an exotic place. You start to feel envious… and the cycle continues.

Hour of Power

The “Hour of Power” is a concept I heard from Vincent Tolman, in which you dedicate thirty minutes after waking and thirty minutes before sleep to focusing on virtue and the good. This hour determines the qualities of your thoughts, and how you feel throughout each day.



The thoughts you have as you wake up exert a far greater influence on you than you might expect. They set the tone for the day, so to speak. When someone begins the day in a bad mood, we say, “Did you get out of bed on the wrong side?” The first thing you do upon waking is, in a sense, what you worship. Do you reach for your phone, scrolling through messages, emails, notifications, and the news - starting the day rushed, anxious, and distracted? Or do you pause, spending time in prayer or meditation, beginning the day on the right foot?



I personally wake up by writing down my dreams (if I can remember them), and then I spend time in prayer. There are prayer books which contain prayers for the morning, afternoon, and evening. Religion is not a system to be followed mechanically and occasionally, it is a way of life. Before sleep, I spend some time being grateful for what I have, and expressing my love to God, my late parents, loved ones, family, friends, community, and lastly to myself.



As the mystic Gurdjieff stated: “Religion is doing; a man does not merely think his religion or feel it, he lives his religion as much as he is able, otherwise it is not religion but fantasy or philosophy. Whether he likes it or not he shows his attitude towards religion by his actions and he can show his attitude only by his actions. Therefore if his actions are opposed to those which are demanded by a given religion he cannot assert that he belongs to that religion.”(In Search of the Miraculous)

The Inner Fortress of the Mind



Your mind is like an inner fortress, heavily guarded, with the king at the central keep. The guards - representing your good thoughts, good words, and good deeds - defend you against the enemy. The enemy is always present, and every sinful thought throughout the day symbolises the advance of its armies. The first description of sin occurs in Genesis 4:7, where it is described as a lurking presence, like a predator, patiently watching to catch its prey.



We may feel protected in our impenetrable fortress, but the enemy’s assault is often subtle, not a frontal attack. Sometimes the walls are breached at an unguarded corner, or a guard is bribed and the drawbridge is lowered in the night. Chaos erupts and the king tries to escape, but the fortress that once protected him now traps him. With nowhere to go, he is captured.



But if you are conscious of every time you sin or “miss the mark”, and pray for protection, then you can stop the enemy from gaining access to your inner fortress. Christ repeatedly calls us to be watchful, alert, and spiritually vigilant. As He taught in the Sermon on the Mount, sin begins in the heart: in our thoughts, desires, and intentions. The true battleground lies within the self.



Spiritual warfare is part of our everyday life. “All spiritual life is based on thoughts. Progress in spiritual life depends on our thoughts.” (St. Paisios of Mount Athos, Spiritual Counsels, Volume III: Spiritual Struggle).



In Christianity, a simple prayer is, “Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.”



Or:







Saint Michael the Archangel,
defend us in battle.
Be our safeguard against the wickedness and snares of the devil.
May God rebuke him, we humbly pray,
and you, O Prince of the heavenly hosts,
by the power of God,
cast into hell Satan and all the evil spirits,
who roam throughout the world seeking the ruin of souls.
Amen.



No matter what troubles your mind, if you pray protective prayers every time you are tempted, practise the Hour of Power, use a prayer book, and treat religion as a way of life rather than an occasional exercise, you grow in spiritual vigilance and make it far more difficult for destructive influences to gain entry into the inner fortress of your mind. Focus not on your own will, but on the will of God. Then all will be well.



Much love,
